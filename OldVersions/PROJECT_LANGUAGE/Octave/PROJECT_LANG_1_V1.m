// About:
// I decided to make Octave the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Octave) as Octave is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Octave programming language. It only makes sense to Octave the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
